# The Preliminary Mission Design Tool

This is the code used in the paper titled "Design and guidance of a multi-active debris removal mission" by Minduli C. Wijayatunga, Roberto Armellin, Harry Holt, Laura Pirovano & Aleksander A. Lidtke. This code generates multi-target fuel and time optimal tours, under low thrust propulsion, taking J2 pertubations, drag, eclipses and duty cycles into account. The PMDT can provide reference trajectories for tracking and can compute 5 year low-thrust tours within seconds. 

The code also contains a Matlab app to use the PMDT directly.
