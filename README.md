# Preliminary Mission Design Tool (PMDT)

This repository contains the code for the **Preliminary Mission Design Tool (PMDT)**, used in the paper titled ["Design and guidance of a multi-active debris removal mission"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42064-023-0159-3) by **Minduli C. Wijayatunga**, **Roberto Armellin**, **Harry Holt**, **Laura Pirovano**, and **Aleksander A. Lidtke**.

The PMDT generates multi-target, fuel- and time-optimal tours for active debris removal (ADR) missions using low-thrust propulsion. It accounts for various mission factors, such as J2 perturbations, drag, eclipses, and duty cycles. The tool can rapidly compute reference trajectories, providing solutions for 5-year low-thrust tours within seconds.

The tool was developed for a multi-debris mission concept studied in collaboration with **Astroscale** and **Rocket Lab**, where two spacecraft work together to remove multiple debris in a single mission. A visual representation of this mission concept is shown below:

Additionally, the code includes a **Matlab app** that allows users to interact with the PMDT directly. This app can be generated by running the `PMDTApp.m` file.

If you prefer to run the code without using the app, you can use the `main.m` file, where you can directly change the parameters for the mission.
